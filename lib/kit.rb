# Raised when trying to load a sound file which can't be found at the path specified
class SoundNotFoundError < RuntimeError; end

# This class keeps track of the sounds that are used in a song. It provides a
# central place for storing sound data, and most usefully, handles converting
# sounds in different formats to a standard format.
# 
# For example, if a song requires a sound that is mono/8-bit, another that is
# stereo/8-bit, and another that is stereo/16-bit, it can't mix them together
# because they are in different formats. Kit however automatically handles the
# details of converting them to a common format. If you add sounds to the kit
# using add(), sounds that you get using get_sample_data() will be in a canonical
# format.
#
# When choosing the canonical format, Kit uses the highest quality of the available
# sounds. So if a mono/8-bit, stereo/8-bit, and stereo/16-bit sound are added,
# when you retrieve each one using get_sample_data() they will be stereo/16-bit.
#
# Note that this means that each time a new sound is added to the Kit, the canonical
# format might change, if the incoming sound has a higher bits per sample or
# number of channels than any of the existing sounds. Therefore, all of the sounds
# used by a Song should be added to the Kit before generation begins. If you
# create Song objects by using SongParser, this will be taken care of for you (as
# long as you don't modify the Kit afterward).
