		<h1>BEATS</h1>
		<p>is a drum machine written in pure Ruby. Feed it a song notated in YAML, and it will generate a Wave file possessing impeccable timing and feel. Here is an example song:</p>
		<p><pre><code>Song:
  Tempo: 120
  Structure:
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2

Verse:
  - bass.wav:      X.......X.......
  - snare.wav:     ....X.......X...
  - hh_closed.wav: X.X.X.X.X.X.X...
  - hh_open.wav:   ..............X.
  - ride.wav:      X...............

Chorus:
  - bass.wav:      X...X...XX..X.XXX...X...X...X...
  - snare.wav:     ....X.......X.......X......X.XXX
  - hh_closed.wav: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  - ride.wav:      ........X.......X.......X......X</pre></code></p>

		<h2>Creating Songs</h2>
		<p>Songs are notated using <a href="#">YAML</a>, so each song file is just a plain text file you can edit in TextEdit, NotePad, or whatever.</p>
		<p>Each song is divided into one or more patterns. A pattern represents a section of the song, such as a verse, chorus, or bridge. Each pattern in turn has one or more tracks. Each track represents an individual sound, such as a bass drum, snare, hi-hat, etc.</p>
		<p>Songs should start with a header indicating the tempo and the order that the patterns should be played. Patterns can optionally be repeated one or more times. For example, adding "x2" after the pattern name means to play it twice. Since this is YAML, lines must be indented correctly. Also, each pattern in the structure should be preceded by a dash. Here is an example header:</p>
		<p><pre><code>Song:
  Tempo: 120
  Structure:
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2
    - Bridge:  x1
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2</code></pre></p>
		<p>One or more patterns should follow the header. (If there are no patterns, there is nothing to play!) Each pattern definition starts with the pattern name, followed by the rhythm for each track on separate lines.</p>
		<p><pre><code>Verse:
  - bass.wav:      X.......X.......
  - snare.wav:     ....X.......X...
  - hh_closed.wav: X.X.X.X.X.X.X...
  - hh_open.wav:   ..............X.
  - ride.wav:      X...............</code></pre></p>
		<p>Each track line starts with the sound file to use (only 8 or 16-bit Wave files are supported). If the Wave file you want to use is not in the current working directory, be sure to include the full path. Track lines must be indented properly and start with a dash.</p>
		<p>The track rhythm follows the sound name. An <code>X</code> means that the sound should be triggered, and a <code>.</code> indicates a "rest" between triggers. Each <code>X</code> or <code>.</code> represents a 16th note. You only need to indicate the downbeat of each sound, since sounds will play their full duration (unless cut off by another trigger). For example, to play a quarter note rhythm, <code>X...X...X...X...</code> will do the trick.</p>
		<p>As a final note, patterns and the song header can come in any order. If you want to include the song header at the end of the file, you can. You can also mix up the order that patterns are defined.</p>
