		<h1>BEATS</h1>
		<p>is a drum machine written in pure Ruby. Feed it a song notated in YAML, and it will produce a precision-milled Wave file of impeccable timing and feel. Here is an example song:</p>
		<p><pre><code>Song:
  Tempo: 120
  Structure:
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2

Verse:
  - bass.wav:      X.......X.......
  - snare.wav:     ....X.......X...
  - hh_closed.wav: X.X.X.X.X.X.X...
  - hh_open.wav:   ..............X.
  - ride.wav:      X...............

Chorus:
  - bass.wav:      X...X...XX..X.XXX...X...X...X...
  - snare.wav:     ....X.......X.......X......X.XXX
  - hh_closed.wav: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  - ride.wav:      ........X.......X.......X......X</pre></code></p>

		<p class="last">And here is what it sounds like after getting the Beats treatment: <a href="#">beat.wav</a>. What a glorious groove!</p>

		<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
		<p>BEATS runs from the command-line. The syntax:</p>
		<p><code><pre>beats [options] INPUT [OUTPUT]</pre></code></p>
		<p><code>INPUT</code> should be the YAML file for your song. <code>OUTPUT</code> should be the <code>*.wav</code> file where BEATS will place the generated sound. If omitted, it will default to <code>INPUT</code> but with a <code>.wav</code> extension. (For example, the sound for <code>my_song.txt</code> would be saved to <code>my_song.wav</code>).</p>
		<p>BEATS supports two command-line options, which can be used together or separately:</p>
		<p><code><pre>-s, --split
    Save each track to a separate Wave file,
    instead of combining them into one.

-p, --pattern
    Only generate a single pattern (such as a
    verse or chorus), instead of the entire song.</pre></code></p>
	<p>Now read on for more about the BEATS file format.</p>

		<h2>Creating Songs</h2>
		<p>Songs are notated using <a href="#">YAML</a>, so each song file is just a plain text file you can edit in TextEdit, NotePad, or whatever. The extension doesn't matter.</p>
		<p>Each song is divided into one or more patterns. A pattern represents a section of the song, such as a verse, chorus, or bridge. Each pattern in turn has one or more tracks. Each track represents an individual sound, such as a bass drum, snare, or hi-hat.</p>
		<p>Songs should start with a header indicating the tempo and the order that the patterns should be played. Patterns can optionally be repeated one or more times. For example, adding "x2" after the pattern name means to play it twice. Since this is YAML, lines must be indented correctly. Also, each pattern in the structure should be preceded by a dash. Here is an example header:</p>
		<p><pre><code>Song:
  Tempo: 120
  Structure:
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2
    - Bridge:  x1
    - Verse:   x4
    - Chorus:  x2</code></pre></p>
		<p>One or more patterns should follow the header. (If there are no patterns, there is nothing to play!) Each pattern definition starts with the pattern name, followed by the rhythm for each track on separate lines.</p>
		<p><pre><code>Verse:
  - bass.wav:      X.......X.......
  - snare.wav:     ....X.......X...
  - hh_closed.wav: X.X.X.X.X.X.X...
  - hh_open.wav:   ..............X.
  - ride.wav:      X...............</code></pre></p>
		<p>Each track line starts with the sound file to use (only 8 or 16-bit Wave files are supported). You can either use a relative or absolute path. Relative paths are from the path of the song file. Track lines must be indented properly and start with a dash.</p>
		<p>The track rhythm follows the sound name. An <code>X</code> means that the sound should be triggered, and a <code>.</code> indicates a "rest" between triggers. Each <code>X</code> or <code>.</code> represents a 16th note. You only need to indicate the downbeat of each sound, since sounds will play their full duration (unless cut off by another trigger). For example, to play a quarter note rhythm, <code>X...X...X...X...</code> will do the trick.</p>
		<p>As a final note, patterns and the song header can come in any order. If you want to include the song header at the end of the file, you can. You can also mix up the order that patterns are defined.</p>

		<h2>Where To Find Drum Sounds</h2>
		<p>BEATS comes with 20 <span style="text-decoration: line-through">high-quality</span> drum sounds sampled from a Casio SA-20 keyboard that the author got when he was 8 years old.</p>
		<p>In case that's not enough, here are some sites that have free drum samples available for download:</p>
