Beats Drum Machine
------------------

Beats is a command-line drum machine written in pure Ruby. Feed it a song notated in YAML, and it will produce a precision-milled *.wav file of impeccable timing and feel. Here's an example song:

    Song:
      Tempo: 105
      Flow:
        - Verse:  x4
        - Chorus: x4
      Kit:
        - bass:     house_2_1.wav
        - snare:    roland_tr_909_2.wav
        - hihat:    house_2_5.wav
        - cowbell:  big_beat_5.wav
        - deep:     house_2_2.wav

    Verse:
      - bass:     X..X...X..X.....
      - snare:    ....X.......X...
      - hihat:    ..X...X...X...X.

    Chorus:
      - bass:     X..X...X..X.....
      - snare:    ....X.......X...
      - hihat:    XXXXXXXXXXXXX...
      - cowbell:  ....XX.X..X.X...
      - deep:     .............X..

Installation
------------

To install the latest stable version (2.0.0) from [rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org/gems/beats), run the following from the command line:

    gem install beats

Note that if you are installing using the default version of Ruby that comes with MacOS X, you might get a file permission error. If that happens, use `sudo gem install beats` instead. If you are using RVM, plain `gem install beats` should work fine.

Once installed, you can then run Beats from the command-line using the `beats` command.

Beats is not very useful unless you have some sounds to use with it. You can download some example sounds from [http://beatsdrummachine.com](http://beatsdrummachine.com/download#drum-kits).


Usage
-----

Beats runs from the command-line. Run `beats -h` to see the available options. For more detailed instructions, visit [https://github.com/jstrait/beats/wiki/Usage](https://github.com/jstrait/beats/wiki/Usage) on the [Beats Wiki](https://github.com/jstrait/beats/wiki).

What's New
----------

The latest stable version of Beats is 2.0.0, released on _________.

This release only has minor user visible changes. It is primarily a modernization release, and contains some backwards incompatible changes.

* Track rhythms can now have spaces in them. For example, this is now a valid rhythm: `X... .... X... ....`
* Installing the gem is now simpler, since it no longer requires installing `syck` via an extension.
* Wave files using `WAVEFORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` format can now be used, due to upgrading the WaveFile gem to v0.8.1 behind the scenes.
* Backwards incompatible changes:
  * Song files containing a "Structure" section are no longer supported. a "Flow" section should be used instead. Support for the "Structure" section has been deprecated since v1.2.1, released in 2011.
  * Track rhythms can no longer start with a "|" character. For example, this is no longer a valid rhythm: "|X...X...". However, bar lines are still allowed to appear elsewherein the rhyhtm. For example, this is a valid rhythm: "X...X...|X...X...|". The reason for this change is that a rhythm starting with "|" is parsed as a YAML scalar now that Beats is using the Psych YAML library behind the scenes. The fact that Syck didn't treat rhythms starting with a "|" as a YAML scalar appears to have been a bug?
* The minimum supported Ruby version is now 1.9.3, instead of 1.8.7


Local Development
-----------------

First, install the required dependencies:

    bundle install

To run Beats locally, use `bundle exec` and run `bin/beats`, to avoid using any installed gem executable. For example:

    bundle exec bin/beats -v

To run the tests:

    bundle exec rake test
