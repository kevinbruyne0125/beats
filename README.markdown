Beats
-----

Beats is a pure-Ruby drum machine. It allows you to take individual sounds, such as a bass drum, snare drum and a cymbal, and splice them together into a drum beat. You can define the drum beat using a YAML file.

Beats is undergoing active development, so things are not guaranteed to remain stable.
